# What is this?

2023 was an eye-opener for me as a person in IT. Note that I did not use the term "Software Engineer" or "Developer". I feel as though I have lost that term.

This repo is an ongoing work in progress to track how I am going to fix my skills. I will be noting any books that I have read as well as my work on programming problems that I find.

I have determined that I need to re-learn Math (potentially from linear algebra and upwards) and software engineering. This readme will list books I have read (with potential links to reviews) and books I plan to read.

For problems that I experience, I will break them down into location and language. For example, coding questions in Leetcode will be located in it's respective directory. Problems will be organized in child directories which may have multiple languages. Multiple languages will be used if I am trying to apply knowledge for a language I am trying to understand better.

As a visual:
